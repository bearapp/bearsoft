<p style="line-height: 200%"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Q1. Android can only keep 500 calls, how can you make it to unlimited?</b><br>
A. We backup the call log into SD card automatically, when we display the call 
log, we display the backup ones as well. The only thing you need to do is turn 
on &quot;Auto Backup&quot; and &quot;Display Backup&quot; in settings, we will do the rest.<br>
<br>
<b>Q2. Where is my backup?</b><br>
A. Typically, the backup database was stored in the following files in your SD 
card: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BearContact: /data/BearDialer/BearCallLog.db<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BearContact++: /data/BearDialerPro/BearCallLog.db<br>
<br>
<b>Q3. Can I backup and restore the database file?</b><br>
A. Of cause, you can backup it to your PC or cloud. Just restore it if you 
change your phone or SD card, you will be able to keep your call history 
forever.<br>
<br>
<b>Q4. Is my backup safe?</b><br>
A. Yes, since almost all apps can access the SD card, we encrypt all data in the 
database.<br>
<br>
<b>Q5. I purchased BearContact++, do I need to keep BearContact?</b><br>
A. No you don&#39;t. We highly recommend you to uninstall BearContact after the 
installation of BearContact++. As you seen in Q2, the backup database of them 
are different from each other, you will be confused if you keep them both. <br>
<br>
<b>Q6. Your app does not support my language, can I help you to translate it?</b><br>
A. It&#39;s my honor, give me a mail for more details.<br>
<br>
<b>Q7. I have a question, problem, wish ...</b><br>
A. Feel free to mail me (<a href="mailto:skzengbear@gmail.com" style="text-decoration: none"><span style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#CC6600">skzengbear@gmail.com</font></span></a>).</span></p>
